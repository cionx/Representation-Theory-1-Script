\section{Nilpotent and solvable Lie algebras}





\subsection{Definition, examples and properties}


\begin{defi}
 Let $A$ be an associative $k$-algebra. An element $a \in A$ is called \emph{nilpotent} if $a^n = 0$ for some $n \geq 1$. Given a Lie algebra $\g$ an element $x \in \g$ is called \emph{$\ad$-nilpotent} if $\ad(x) \in \End_k(\g)$ is nilpotent.
\end{defi}


\begin{lem}\label{lem: nilpotent implies ad-nilpotent}
 If $A$ is an associative $k$-algebra and $x \in A$ nilpotent then $x$ is also $\ad$-nilpotent.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 Let $\lambda_x \colon A \to A, a \mapsto xa$ and $\rho_x \colon A \to A, a \mapsto ax$. Because $x$ is nilpotent both $\lambda_x$ and $\rho_x$ are nilpotent. Because $A$ is associative $\lambda_x$ and $\rho_x$ commute. Hence $\ad(x) = \lambda_x - \rho_x$ is the sum of two commuting, nilpotent endomorphisms, and therefore also nilpotent.
\end{proof}


\begin{defi}
 Let $g$ be a Lie algebra. Define $\g^0 \coloneqq \g$ and $\g^{i+1} \coloneqq [\g,\g^i]$ for all $i \in \N$. Then
 \[
  \g = \g^0 \supseteq \g^1 \supseteq \g^2 \supseteq \dots
 \]
 is called the \emph{central series} of $\g$. Also define $\g^{(0)} \coloneqq \g$ and $\g^{(i+1)} \coloneqq [\g^{(i)},\g^{(i)}]$ for all $i \in \N$. Then
 \[
  \g^{(0)} \supseteq \g^{(1)} \supseteq \g^{(2)} \supseteq \dots
 \]
 is called the \emph{derived series} of $\g$. $\g$ is called \emph{nilpotent} if $\g^i = 0$ for some $i$ and \emph{solvable} if $g^{(i)} = 0$ for some $i$.
\end{defi}


\begin{expls}
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   Every nilpotent Lie algebra $\g$ is also solvable because $\g^{(i)} \subseteq \g^i$ for every $i \in \N$.
  \item
   The upper triangular matrices $\tl_n(k)$ are solvable. But they are not nilpotent.
  \item
   The strictly upper triangular matrices $\n_n(k)$ not only solvable but also nilpotent.
  \item
   If $n \geq 2$ then $\sll_2(\Cbb)$ is simple and therefore $[\sll_n(\Cbb),\sll_n(\Cbb)] = \sll_n(\Cbb)$. Since $[\gl_n(\Cbb),\gl_n(\Cbb)] = \sll_n(\Cbb)$ it follows that $\gl_n(\Cbb)$ is not solvable.
  \item
   If $\g$ is abelian then $\g$ is nilpotent and therefore also solvable.
  \item
   Every one-dimensional Lie algebra is abelian and therefore nilpotent and also solvable. The same goes for the two-dimensional abelian Lie algebra. The two-di\-men\-si\-o\-nal non-abelian Lie algebra $\g$ has a basis $x$,$y$ with $[x,y] = x$. Therefore $\g$ is solvable but not nilpotent.
  \item
   A \emph{Heisenberg Lie algebra} consists of a real vector space with basis $P_1, \dotsc, P_n$, $Q_1, \dotsc, Q_n$, $C$ together with the Lie bracket satisfying the following conditions:
   \[
    [P_i, P_j] = [Q_i, Q_j] = [P_i, C] = [Q_i, C] = 0
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    [P_i, Q_j] = \delta_{ij} C.
   \]
   This defines a nilpotent Lie algebra.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{expls}


\begin{prop}\label{prop: properties of solvable and nilpotent}
 Let $\g$ be a Lie algebra.
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   If $\h$ is a Lie algebra and $f \colon \g \to \h$ a Lie algebras homomorphism then $f(\g)^i = f(\g^i)$ and $f(\g)^{(i)} = f(\g^{(i)})$ for all $i \geq 0$.
  \item
   If $\g$ is nilpotent (resp.\ solvable) then any Lie subalgebra $\h \subseteq \g$ and any quotient of $\g$ (by an ideal $I$) is nilpotent (resp.\ nilpotent).
  \item
   If $I \subideal \g$ with $I \subseteq Z(\g)$ and $\g/I$ is nilpotent then $\g$ is nilpotent.
  \item
   If $\g \neq 0$ is nilpotent then $Z(\g) \neq 0$.
  \item
   If $\g$ is nilpotent and $x \in \g$ then $x$ is $\ad$-nilpotent.
  \item
   If $I \subideal \g$ then $I^i$ and $I^{(i)}$ are ideals inside $\g$ for all $i \geq 0$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   It suficies to show that for any two subsets $X, Y \subseteq \g$
   \[
    f([X,Y])= [f(X),f(Y)]
   \]
   the statement then follows inductively. It holds because $f$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism and therefore
   \begin{align*}
    f([X,Y])
    &= f(\vspan_k \{[x, y] \mid x \in X, y \in Y\}) \\
    &= \vspan_k \{f([x, y]) \mid x \in X, y \in Y\} \\
    &= \vspan_k \{[f(x),f(y)] \mid x \in X, y \in Y\} \\
    &= \vspan_k \{[x',y'] \mid x' \in f(X), y' \in f(Y)\} \\
    &= [f(X),f(Y)].
   \end{align*}
  \item
   The statement about subalgebras follows from $\h^i \subseteq \g^i$ and $\h^{(i)} \subseteq \g^{(i)}$ for all $i \in \N$. The statement about quotient follow by using the canonical projection $\pi \colon \g \to \g/I$. Because $\pi$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism it follows that
   \[
    (\g/I)^i = \pi(\g)^i = \pi(\g^i) = 0
   \]
   for $i$ big enough. For solvable $\g$ the corresponding statements follow in the same way.
  \item
   Let $\pi \colon \g \to \g/I$ be the canonical projection. Because $\g/I$ is nilpotent there exists some $i \geq 0$ with $(\g/I)^i = 0$ and therefore
   \[
    0 = (\g/I)^i = \pi(\g)^i = \pi(\g^i).
   \]
   Thus $\g^i \subseteq I \subseteq Z(G)$ and hence $\g^{i+1} = 0$.
  \item
   Let $i \in \N$ be minimal with $\g^i \neq 0$ but $\g^{i+1} = 0$. Then $\g^i \subseteq Z(\g)$ and thus $Z(\g) \neq 0$.
  \item
   Since $\g$ is nilpotent there exists some $i \in \N$ with $\g^i = 0$. Then
   \[
    (\ad(x))^i(\g) \subseteq \g^i = 0,
   \]
   so $(\ad(x))^i = 0$.
  \item
   This follows inductively by using that $[I,J]$ is an ideal inside $\g$ for any $I,J \subideal \g$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}\label{cor: solvable via ses}
 If $I \subideal \g$ is an ideal inside a Lie algebra $\g$ then $\g$ is solvable if and only if both $I$ and $\g/I$ are solvable.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
 If $\g$ is solvable then $I$ and $\g/I$ are also solvable by Proposition~\ref{prop: properties of solvable and nilpotent}. Suppose that on the other hand both $I$ and $\g/I$ are solvable. Then there exists $i_1, i_2 \in \N$ with $(\g/I)^{(i_1)} = 0$ and $I^{i_2} = 0$. Let $\pi \colon \g \to \g/I, x \mapsto x + I$ be the canical projection. Because
 \[
  0 = (\g/I)^{(i_1)} = \pi(\g)^{(i_1)} = \pi(\g^{(i_1)})
 \]
 it follows that $\g^{(i_1}) \subseteq \ker \pi = I$. Thus
 \[
  \g^{(i_1 + i_2)} = (\g^{(i_1)})^{i_2} \subseteq I^{i_2} = 0,
 \]
 which shows that $\g$ is solvable.
\end{proof}


\begin{rem}
 The analogeous statement about nilpotency does not necessarily hold. Take for example the two-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra $\g$, which has a basis $x,y$ with $[x,y] = x$. Then the one-dimensional linear subspace $I \coloneqq kx$ is an abelian ideal in $\g$ and in particular nilpotent. The quotient $\g/I$ is one-dimensional and therefore also nilpotent. But $\g$ itself is not nilpotent.
\end{rem}


\begin{cor}\label{cor: sum of solvable ideals is solvable}
 Let $\g$ be a Lie algebra and $I, J \subideal \g$ two solvable ideal. Then $I + J$ is also solvable.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
 Because $J$ is solvable the same goes for $J/(I \cap J)$. Hence in the short exact sequence
 \[
  0 \to I \to I+J \to (I+J)/I \to 0
 \]
 both $I$ and $(I+J)/I \cong J/(I \cap J)$ are solvable. Hence $I+J$ is solvable by Corollary~\ref{cor: solvable via ses}.
\end{proof}


\begin{defi}
 Let $\g$ be a finite dimenisonal Lie algebra. It follows from Corollary~\ref{cor: sum of solvable ideals is solvable} that $\g$ contains a unique maximal solvable ideal. This ideal is called the \emph{radical} of $\g$ and is denoted by $\rad \g$.
\end{defi}


\begin{rem}
 If $\g$ is a Lie algebra and $I, J \subideal \g$ two nilpotent ideals, then it can be shown that the ideal $I + J$ is also a nilpotent. It follows that every finite dimensional Lie algebra $\g$ has a unique maxmial nilpotent ideal, which is then called the \emph{nilradical} of $\g$.
\end{rem}







\subsection{Engelâ€™s theorem}


From now on \emph{all} fields over which we work will be assumed to be algebraically closed, unless otherwise specified.


If $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $k$ and $x \in \End_k(V)$ a nilpotent endomorphism then $0$ is the only eigenvalue of $x$ (and occurs with multiplicity $n$) (here it is used that $k$ is algebraically closed). Hence there exists an eigenvector $v \in V$, $v \neq 0$ with $x(v) = 0$. The following proposition generalizes this observations for linear Lie algebras consisting of nilpotent endomorphisms.


\begin{prop}\label{prop: common eigenvector for nilpotent Lie algebras}
 Let $V \neq 0$ be a finite dimensional vector space and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a Lie subalgebra such that every $x \in \g$ in nilpotent. Then there exists $v \in V$ with $v \neq 0$ and $x(v) = 0$ for every $x \in \g$, i.e.\ $v$ is a common eigenvector of all $x \in \g$ (all of which are nilpotent and thus have $0$ as their only eigenvalue).
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 The statement can be then shown by induction over $\dim \g$. For $\dim \g = 0$ the statement follows from $\g = 0$ and for $\dim \g = 1$ the statement follows as previously discussed from $\g = k x$ with $x$ being a nilpotent endomorphism of $V$.
 
 So let $\dim \g \geq 2$ and suppose that the statement holds for all smaller dimensions. Let $I \subseteq \g$ be a maximal proper Lie subalgebra (such a subalgebra exists because it is precisely one of maximal dimension strictly smaller than $n$). Any $x \in \g$ with $x \neq 0$ spans a one-dimensional subalgebra $k x$ of $\g$; because $\dim \g \geq 2$ it is a proper one. This show that $I \neq 0$. It turns out that $I$ is already in ideal in $\g$:
 
 By assumption $\g$ consists of nilpotent endomorphisms and therefore of $\ad$-nilpotent elemenents. In particular every $x \in I$ acts nilpotent on $\g$ via $\ad(x)$ with $I$ being an $\ad(x)$-invariant linear subspace. Therefore every $x \in I$ acts on the quotient vector space $\g/I$ by an induced nilpotent endomorphism
 \[
  \overline{\ad}(x) \colon \g/I \to \g/I, \quad y + I \mapsto \ad(x)(y) + I = [x,y] + I.
 \]
 As the map $\overline{\ad} \colon I \to \gl(\g/I)$ is an homomorphism of Lie algebras (because $\ad$ is) the image $\{\overline{\ad}(x) \mid x \in I\} \subseteq \gl(\g/I)$ is an Lie subalgebra, consisting of nilpotent endomorphisms. From $I \neq 0$ it follows that $\dim \g/I < \dim \g$, so by induction assumption there exists some $y \in \g$ with $\overline{\ad}(x)(y+I) = 0$ for every $x \in I$ and $y+I \neq 0+I$. Hence $[x,y] \in I$ for every $x \in I$ but $y \neq I$. Hence $y \in N_\g(I)$ with $y \neq I$, so $I$ is properly contained in its normalizer. As $I$ is a maximal proper subalgebra of $\g$ it follows that $N_\g(I) = \g$, so $I$ is an ideal. It is even one of codimension $1$:
 
 If $I$ had not codimension $1$ then $\dim \g/I > 1$. Then $\g/I$ contains a one-dimensional proper subalgebra $L$ (as seen above), and the preimage $\pi^{-1}(J)$ under the canonical projection $\pi \colon \g \to \g/I$ is then a proper subalgebra of $\g$ properly containing $I$, which contradicts the maximality of $I$. Hence $I$ has codimension $1$.
 
 As $I \subseteq \g$ has codimension $1$ there exists some $y \in \g$ with $g = I \oplus ky$ (as vector spaces). Because $\dim I < \dim \g$ it follows from the induction assumption that
 \[
  U \coloneqq \{v \in V \mid \text{$x(v) = 0$ for every $x \in I$}\} = \bigcap_{x \in I} \ker x
 \]
 is a nonzero linear subspace of $V$. It sufficies to show that $U$ is $y$-invariant: Then there exists some eigenvector $u \in U$ of $y$ for which necessarily $y(u) = 0$. If $u\in U$ then $[x,y] \in I$ for every $x \in I$ because $I \subideal \g$ and therefore
 \[
  x(y(u)) = [x,y](u) - y(x(u)) = 0 - y(0) = 0.
 \]
 Hence $y(u) \in U$, so $U$ is $y$-invariant.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}\label{prop: stuff for Engels theorem}
 Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space with $n = \dim V$ and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a Lie subalgebra. Then the following are equivalent:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{enum: engels g consists of nilpotent endomorphisms}
   $\g$ consists of nilpotent endomorphisms.
  \item\label{enum: engels there exists a complete flag shifted by g}
   There exists a complete flag of $V$
   \[
    V = V_n \supsetneq V_{n-1} \supsetneq V_{n-2} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0,
   \]
   with $x(V_i) \subseteq V_{i-1}$ for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$.
  \item\label{enum: engels represented by strictly upper triangular matrices}
   There exists a basis of $V$ with respect to which every $x \in \g$ is represented by an strictly upper triangular matrix.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 The implication \ref{enum: engels g consists of nilpotent endomorphisms} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{enum: engels there exists a complete flag shifted by g} can be shown by induction over $\dim V$. For $\dim V = 1$ set $V_0 \coloneqq 0$ and $V_1 \coloneqq V$. By assumption every $x \in \g$ acts nilpotent on $V$, so $x(V) = 0$ because $V$ is one-dimensional. Thus $V = V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0$ is a complete flag for $V$ satisfying the condititons.
   
 Now let $\dim V = n \geq 2$ and suppose the statement holds for all smaller dimensions. Let $v \in V$, $v \neq 0$ with $x(v) = 0$ for every $x \in \g$ and $W \coloneqq V / kv$. Every $x \in \g$ induces an endomorphism
 \[
  \overline{x} \colon W \to W, \quad v + kv \mapsto x(v) + kv.
 \]
 By induction assumption exists a complete flag
 \[
  W = W_{n-1} \supsetneq W_{n-2} \supsetneq W_{n-3} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq W_1 \supsetneq W_0 = 0
 \]
 with $\overline{x}(W_i) \subseteq W_{i-1}$ for every $x \in \g$ and $i = 1, \dotsc, n-1$. By setting $V_i \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(W_{i-1})$ for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$ and $V_0 = 0$ it follows that
 \[
  V = V_n \supsetneq V_{n-1} \supsetneq V_{n-2} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0,
 \]
 is a complete flag of $V$. On the one hand $x(V_1) = x(kv) = 0 = V_0$ for every $x \in \g$ and on the other hand
 \[
  \pi(x(V_i))
  = \overline{x}(\pi(V_i))
  = \overline{x}(W_{i-1})
  \subseteq W_{i-2}
 \]
 and therefore $x(V_i) \subseteq \pi^{-1}(W_{i-2}) = V_{i-1}$ for every $i = 2, \dotsc, n$.
 
 The implications \ref{enum: engels there exists a complete flag shifted by g} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{enum: engels represented by strictly upper triangular matrices} and \ref{enum: engels represented by strictly upper triangular matrices} $\Rightarrow$ \ref{enum: engels g consists of nilpotent endomorphisms} are basic facts from linear algebra.
\end{proof}


\begin{thrm}[Engel]
 Let $\g$ be a finite dimensional Lie algebra. Then $\g$ is nilpotent if and only if all its elements are $\ad$-nilpotent.
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
 If $\g$ is nilpotent then there exists some $i \in \N$ with $\g^i = 0$, from which is follows from $\ad(x)^i(y) \in \g^i$ for every $x,y \in \g$ that $\ad(x)^i = 0$ for every $x \in \g$, hence every $x \in \g$ is $\ad$-nilpotent.
 
 On the other hand suppose that $\g$ consists of $\ad$-nilpotent elemenents. If $\g = Z(\g)$ then $\g$ is abelian and hence nilpotent, so it sufficies to show the statement under the additional assumption that $Z(\g) \subsetneq \g$. Because $\g/Z(\g) \cong \ad \g$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\gl(\g)$ consisting of nilpotent Elemenents it follows from Proposition~\ref{prop: stuff for Engels theorem} that $\g/Z(\g)$ is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of $\n_n(k)$ for $n = \dim \g/Z(\g) \geq 1$. Because $\n_n(k)$ is nilpotent the same goes for $\g/Z(\g)$ as seen in Proposition~\ref{prop: properties of solvable and nilpotent}.
\end{proof}


\begin{rem}
 It is not true that every nilpotent Lie-subalgebra $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ with $V$ being a finite dimensional vector space is represented by upper triangular matrices with respect to some basis of $V$. For example the onedimensional subalgebra $k \id_V \subseteq \gl(V)$ is abelian and hence nilpotent, but with respect to every basis of $V$ represented by $kI \subseteq \gl_n(k)$.

\subsection{Lieâ€™s theorem}


From now on we will not only require \emph{every} field $k$ we work with to be algebraically closed, but also to be of characteristic $0$. Unless otherwise stated this holds up to the last page (page \pageref{LastPage}) of this text. In particular all Lie algebras and vector spaces will be assumed to have such a field as their ground field, even if not explicitely stated.


\begin{defi}
 Let $V$ be a representation of a Lie algebra $\g$. For $\lambda \in \g^*$ the linear subspace
 \[
  V_\lambda \coloneqq \{v \in V \mid \text{$x.v = \lambda x$ for every $x \in \g$}\}
 \]
 is called the \emph{$\g$-weight space} of $V$ with \emph{weight} $\lambda$.
\end{defi}



\begin{lem}[Invariance Lemma]
 Let $V$ be a finite dimensional representation of a Lie algebra $\g$ and $I \subideal \g$ an ideal. Then $V$ is also a representation of $I$ by restriction of the action of $\g$ on $V$ to $I$. For $\lambda \in I^*$ let $V_\lambda$ be the $I$-weight space of $V$ with weight $\lambda$. Then $V_\lambda$ is a subrepresentation of $\g$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 For $v \in V$ and $x_1, \dotsc, x_n \in \g$ we will write
 \[
  x_1 \dotsm x_n v \coloneqq x_1.(\dotsc.(x_n.v)).
 \]
 If $V_\lambda = 0$ the statement is clear, so for this proof we fix some $\lambda \in I^*$ with $V_\lambda \neq 0$.
 
 That $V_\lambda$ is a subrepresentation of $\g$ means that $yv \in V_\lambda$ for every $y \in \g$ and $v \in V_\lambda$, which is equivalent to $xyv = \lambda(x)yv$ for every $x \in I$, $y \in \g$ and $v \in V_\lambda$. Because
 \[
  xyv = [x,y]v + yxv = \lambda([x,y])v + \lambda(x)yv \quad \text{for every $x \in I$, $y \in \g$ and $v \in V_\lambda$}
 \]
 this is equivalent to $\lambda([x,y]) = 0$ for every $x \in I$ and $y \in \g$.
 
 Until further notice we fix some $y \in \g$ and $v \in V_\lambda$ with $v \neq 0$. As $V$ is finite dimensional there exists some maximal $n \geq 1$ such that $v$, $yv$, \dots, $y^n v$ are linearly independent. Let
 \[
  W_i \coloneqq \vspan_k(v, yv, \dotsc, y^i v) \quad \text{for every $i = 0, \dotsc, n$}.
 \]
 Because $v$, $yv$, \dots, $y^n v$, $y^{n+1} v$ are linearly dependent it follows that $W_n$ is invariant under the action of $y$.
 
 \begin{claim*}
  The linear subspace $W_i$ is for every $i = 0, \dotsc, n$ a subrepresentation of $I$. With respect to the basis $w$, $yw$, \dots, $y^i w$ of $W_i$ the action of $x \in I$ is represented by an upper triangular matrix where every diagonal entry is $\lambda(x)$.
 \end{claim*}
 \begin{proof}
  The claim can be proven by induction over $i$. As $W_0 = kv$ with $xv = \lambda(x)v$ for every $x \in I$ the claim holds for $i = 0$. Suppose that $i < n$ and that the claim holds for $W_0$, \dots, $W_i$. If $x \in I$ then also $[x,y] \in I$ and therefore
  \[
   x y^{i+1} v
   = \underbrace{[x,y] y^i v}_{\mathclap{\substack{\in W_i \\ \text{by induction}}}} + y x y^i v
   \equiv y x y^i v
   \mod W_i.
  \]
  By induction it is not only $x y^i v \in W_i$ but also $x y^i v + W_{i-1} = \lambda(x) y^i v + W_{i-1}$. Therefore
  \[
   y x y^i v \equiv \lambda(x) y^{i+1} v \mod W_i.
  \]
  This shows the claim for $W_{i+1}$.
 \end{proof}
 
 Let $x \in I$. As $[x,y] \in I$ it follows from the previous claim that the $(n+1)$-dimensional linear subspace $W_n$ is invariant under the action of $[x,y]$, which is given by an endomorphism $\phi_{[x,y]} \in \End_k(W_n)$, and that $\phi_{[x,y]}$ is represented by an upper triangular matrix for which all diagonal entries are $\lambda([x,y])$. It follows that in particular
 \begin{equation}\label{eqn: invariance lemma zero trace}
  \tr \phi_{[x,y]} = (n+1) \lambda([x,y])
 \end{equation}
 On the other hand $W_n$ is invariant under the action of both $x$ (by the claim) and $y$, which act by endomorphisms $\phi_x, \phi_y \in \End_k(V)$. As $V$ is a representation of the Lie algebra $\g$ it follows that $\phi_{[x,y]} = [\phi_x, \phi_y]$ and thus $\tr \phi_{[x,y]} = 0$. Together with \eqref{eqn: invariance lemma zero trace} it follows that $\lambda([x,y]) = 0$.
\end{proof}


As a generalization of Proposition~\ref{prop: common eigenvector for nilpotent Lie algebras} we have the following result about solvable linear Lie algebras.


\begin{thrm}[Lie]\label{thrm: Lieâ€™s theorem}
 Let $V \neq 0$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a solvable Lie subalgebra. Then there exists a common eigenvector for $\g$, i.e.\ some $v \in V$, $v \neq 0$ with $x(v) \in k v$ for every $x \in \g$.
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
 The statement can be shown by induction over $\dim \g$. If $\dim \g = 0$ then $\g = 0$ and any $v \in V$ with $v \neq 0$ does the job. If $\dim \g = 1$ then $\g = k x$ for some $x \in \gl(V)$ with $x \neq 0$. Then any eigenvector of $x$ does the job (since $k$ is assumed to be algebraically closed and $V \neq 0$ such an eigenvector does exist).
 
 Suppose that $\dim \g = n \geq 2$ and the statement holds for every smaller dimension. Similarly to the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop: common eigenvector for nilpotent Lie algebras} we will split this proof into four consecutive parts:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item
   Finding an ideal $I \subideal \g$ of codimension $1$.
  \item
   Finding common eigenvectors for $I$ by induction.
  \item
   Showing that $\g$ stabilizes as nonzero subspace $U \subseteq V$ of such eigenvectors.
  \item
   Writing $\g = I \oplus k y$ (as vector spaces) and finding an eigenvector of $y$ in $U$.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 For the first step notice that $\g$ is nonzero but solvable, so $[\g,\g] \subideal \g$ is a proper ideal. Hence $\g/[\g,\g]$ is nonzero abelian Lie algebra. Therefore there exists a linear subspace $J \subseteq \g/[\g,\g]$ of codimension $1$ and $J$ is an ideal in $\g/[\g,\g]$. Hence the preimage $I = \pi^{-1}(J)$ for the canonical projection $\g \to \g/[\g,\g], x \mapsto x + [\g,\g]$ is an ideal in $\g$ of codimension $1$.
 
 For the second step notice that because $\g$ is solvable the same goes for $I$. So by induction hypothesis there exists a common eigenvector for $I$. Hence there exists some $\lambda \in I^*$ with $U \coloneqq V_\lambda \neq 0$, where we view $V$ as a representation of $\g$ via $x.v = x(v)$ for every $x \in \g$ and $v \in V$.
 
 The third step follows directly from the invariance lemma.
 
 For the fourth step let $y \in \g$ with $\g = I \oplus k y$ (as vector spaces). Since $\g$ stabilizes $U$ this holds in particular for $y$. As $U \neq 0$ it follows that there exists some eigenvector of $y$ inside of $U$, which is then a common eigenvector for $\g$.
\end{proof}


\begin{rem}
 The proof for Lieâ€™s theorem given in the lecture is basically a less structured version of the one in \cite[\S 4.1]{Humphreys}, from where we took the idea of breaking down the proof into four steps to emphasize the similarities with the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop: common eigenvector for nilpotent Lie algebras} (which we found very useful for understanding the structure of the previous proof).
\end{rem}


\begin{prop}\label{prop: common eigenvector for solvable Lie algebras}
 Let $V \neq 0$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space with $n = \dim V$ and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a Lie subalgebra. Then the following are equivalent:
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   $\g$ is solvable.
  \item
   $\g$ stabilizes some complete flag of $V$, i.e.\ there exists a complete flag
   \[
    V = V_n \supsetneq V_{n-1} \supsetneq V_{n-2} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0,
   \]
   with $x(V_i) \subseteq V_i$ for every $x \in \g$ and $i = 0, \dotsc, n$.
  \item
   There exists a basis of $V$ with respect to which every $x \in \g$ is represented by an upper triangular matrix. In particular $\g$ is isomorphic to a Lie-subalgebra of $\tl_n(k)$ for $n = \dim V$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}


\begin{cor}
 A finite-dimensional $k$-Lie algebra $\g$ is solvable if and only if $[\g,\g]$ is nilpotent.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
 If $[\g,\g]$ is nilpotent then $[\g,\g]^{(i)} = 0$ for some $i \in \N$. Hence $\g^{(i+1)} = [\g,\g]^{(i)} = 0$, so $\g$ is solvable.
 
 Suppose that $\g$ is solvable. Then $\ad \g \cong \g/Z(\g)$ is a solvable subalgebra von $\gl(\g)$. By Lieâ€™s theorem there exists a basis of $\g$ with respect to which $\ad x$ is represented by an upper triangular matrix for each $x \in \g$. As $\ad$ is an homomorphism of Lie algebras it follows that with respect to this basis $\ad(x)$ is represented by a strictly upper triangular matrix for every $x \in [\g,\g]$. Hence every $x \in [\g,\g]$ is $\ad$-nilpotent, and therefore also $\ad_{[\g,\g]}$-nilpotent. By Engelâ€™s theorem $[\g,\g]$ is nilpotent.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}\label{cor: irreducible representations of solvable Lie algebras are onedimenisonal}
 Every irreducible representation of a solvable Lie algebra $\g$ over $k$ is onedimensional.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
 Let $\rho \colon \g \to \gl(V)$ be an irreducible representation of $\g$, and therefore in particular $V \neq 0$. Then $\im \rho \subseteq \gl(V)$ is also solvable and by Lieâ€™s theorem there exists a common eigenvector $v \in V$, $v \neq 0$ for $\im \rho$. Because $x.v = \rho(x)(v) \in kv$ for every $x \in \g$ it follows that the onedimensional linear subspace $kv \subseteq V$ is a nonzero subrepresentation of $V$. Because $V$ is irreducible it follows that $V = kv$.
\end{proof}


\begin{rem}
 Corollary~\ref{cor: irreducible representations of solvable Lie algebras are onedimenisonal} is actually equivalent to Lieâ€™s theorem: If $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ is a Lie subalgebra with then $V$ is a representation of $\g$ via $x.v = x(v)$ for every $x \in \g$ and $v \in V$. If $V \neq 0$ is finite dimensional then $V$ contains an irreducible subrepresentation $U$ of $\g$ (simply take some nonzero subrepresentation of minimal dimension.) If $\g$ additionally is solvable then by Corollary~\ref{cor: irreducible representations of solvable Lie algebras are onedimenisonal} the irreducible subrepresentation $U$ is onedimensional, hence of the form $U = kv$ for some $v \in V$ with $v \neq 0$. From the definition of the action of $\g$ on $V$ it follows that $v$ is common eigenvector of $\g$.
 
 As a consequence of this Lieâ€™s theorem as formulated in Theorem~\ref{thrm: Lieâ€™s theorem} was called ``Lieâ€™s theorem -- concrete form'' in the lecture while Corollary~\ref{cor: irreducible representations of solvable Lie algebras are onedimenisonal} was stated as ``Lieâ€™s theorem -- abstract version''.
\end{rem}


\begin{rem}
 Corollary~\ref{cor: irreducible representations of solvable Lie algebras are onedimenisonal} does not hold for general fields $k$, even if algebraically closed. To see this let $k$ be an algebraically closed field with $\chara k = 2$ and $\g \coloneqq \sll_2(k)$. Then $\g$ has a basis $(e,h,f)$ where
 \begin{gather*}
  e = \vect{0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0}, \quad
  h = \vect{1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1} = \vect{1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1}, \quad
  f = \vect{0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0}
 \shortintertext{with}
  [h,e] = [h,f] = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad [e,f] = h.
 \end{gather*}
 Hence $\g$ is solvable. Let $V \coloneqq k^2$ be the natural representation of $\g$, i.e.\ $\g$ acts on $V$ by $x.v = x(v)$ for every $x \in \g$ and $v \in V$. Then
 \[
  e.\vect{x \\ y} =  \vect{y \\ 0}
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  f.\vect{x \\ y} = \vect{0 \\ x}
  \quad \text{for every $\vect{x \\ y} \in V$}.
 \]
 It follows that if $U \subseteq V$ is a nonzero subrepresentation then $U$ contains either $e_1$ or $e_2$, and therefore also the other one. Hence $U = V$, which shows that $V$ is an irreducible representation of $\g$.
