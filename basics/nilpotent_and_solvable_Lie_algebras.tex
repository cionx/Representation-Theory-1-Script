\section{Nilpotent and solvable Lie algebras}





\subsection{Definition und some properties}


\begin{defi}
 Let $A$ be an associative $k$-algebra. An element $a \in A$ is called \emph{nilpotent} if $a^n = 0$ for some $n \geq 1$. Given a Lie algebra $\g$ an element $x \in \g$ is called \emph{$\ad$-nilpotent} if $\ad(x) \in \End_k(\g)$ is nilpotent.
\end{defi}


\begin{lem}
 If $A$ is an associative $k$-algebra and $x \in A$ nilpotent then $x$ is also $\ad$-nilpotent.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 Let $\lambda_x \colon A \to A, a \mapsto xa$ and $\rho_x \colon A \to A, a \mapsto ax$. Because $x$ is nilpotent both $\lambda_x$ and $\rho_x$ are nilpotent. Because $A$ is associative $\lambda_x$ and $\rho_x$ commute. Hence $\ad(x) = \lambda_x - \rho_x$ is the sum of two commuting, nilpotent endomorphisms, and therefore also nilpotent.
\end{proof}


\begin{defi}
 Let $g$ be a Lie algebra. Define $\g^0 \coloneqq \g$ and $\g^{i+1} \coloneqq [\g,\g^i]$ for all $i \in \N$. Then
 \[
  \g = \g^0 \supseteq \g^1 \supseteq \g^2 \supseteq \dots
 \]
 is called the \emph{central series} of $\g$. Also define $\g^{(0)} \coloneqq \g$ and $\g^{(i+1)} \coloneqq [\g^{(i)},\g^{(i)}]$ for all $i \in \N$. Then
 \[
  \g^{(0)} \supseteq \g^{(1)} \supseteq \g^{(2)} \supseteq \dots
 \]
 is called the \emph{derived series} of $\g$. $\g$ is called \emph{nilpotent} if $\g^i = 0$ for some $i$ and \emph{solvable} if $g^{(i)} = 0$ for some $i$.
\end{defi}


It is clear that every nilpotent Lie algebra is also solvable.


\begin{expls}
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   The upper triangular matrices $\tl_n(k)$ are solvable. But they are not nilpotent.
  \item
   The strictly upper triangular matrices $\nl_n(k)$ not only solvable but also nilpotent.
  \item
   If $n \geq 2$ then $\sll_2(\Cbb)$ is simple and therefore $[\sll_n(\Cbb),\sll_n(\Cbb)] = \sll_n(\Cbb)$. Since $[\gl_n(\Cbb),\gl_n(\Cbb)] = \sll_n(\Cbb)$ it follows that $\gl_n(\Cbb)$ is not solvable.
  \item
   If $\g$ is abelian then $\g$ is nilpotent.
  \item
   A \emph{Heisenberg Lie algebra} consists of a real vector space with basis $P_1, \dotsc, P_n$, $Q_1, \dotsc, Q_n$, $C$ together with the Lie bracket satisfying the following conditions:
   \[
    [P_i, P_j] = [Q_i, Q_j] = [P_i, C] = [Q_i, C] = 0
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    [P_i, Q_j] = \delta_{ij} C.
   \]
   This defines a nilpotent Lie algebra.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{expls}


\begin{prop}\label{prop: properties of solvable and nilpotent}
 Let $\g$ be a Lie algebra.
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   If $\h$ is a Lie algebra and $f \colon \g \to \h$ a Lie algebras homomorphism then $f(\g)^i = f(\g^i)$ and $f(\g)^{(i)} = f(\g^{(i)})$ for all $i \geq 0$.
  \item
   If $\g$ is nilpotent (resp.\ solvable) then any Lie subalgebra $\h \subseteq \g$ and any quotient of $\g$ (by an ideal $I$) is nilpotent (resp.\ nilpotent).
  \item
   If $I \subideal \g$ with $I \subseteq Z(\g)$ and $\g/I$ is nilpotent then $\g$ is nilpotent.
  \item
   If $\g \neq 0$ is nilpotent then $Z(\g) \neq 0$.
  \item
   If $\g$ is nilpotent and $x \in \g$ then $x$ is $\ad$-nilpotent.
  \item
   If $I \subideal \g$ then $I^i$ and $I^{(i)}$ are ideals inside $\g$ for all $i \geq 0$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   It suficies to show that for any two subsets $X, Y \subseteq \g$
   \[
    f([X,Y])= [f(X),f(Y)]
   \]
   the statement then follows inductively. It holds because $f$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism and therefore
   \begin{align*}
    f([X,Y])
    &= f(\vspan_k \{[x, y] \mid x \in X, y \in Y\}) \\
    &= \vspan_k \{f([x, y]) \mid x \in X, y \in Y\} \\
    &= \vspan_k \{[f(x),f(y)] \mid x \in X, y \in Y\} \\
    &= \vspan_k \{[x',y'] \mid x' \in f(X), y' \in f(Y)\} \\
    &= [f(X),f(Y)].
   \end{align*}
  \item
   The statement about subalgebras follows from $\h^i \subseteq \g^i$ and $\h^{(i)} \subseteq \g^{(i)}$ for all $i \in \N$. The statement about quotient follow by using the canonical projection $\pi \colon \g \to \g/I$. Because $\pi$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism it follows that
   \[
    (\g/I)^i = \pi(\g)^i = \pi(\g^i) = 0
   \]
   for $i$ big enough. For solvable $\g$ the corresponding statements follow in the same way.
  \item
   Let $\pi \colon \g \to \g/I$ be the canonical projection. Because $\g/I$ is nilpotent there exists some $i \geq 0$ with $(\g/I)^i = 0$ and therefore
   \[
    0 = (\g/I)^i = \pi(\g)^i = \pi(\g^i).
   \]
   Thus $\g^i \subseteq I \subseteq Z(G)$ and hence $\g^{i+1} = 0$.
  \item
   Let $i \in \N$ be minimal with $\g^i \neq 0$ but $\g^{i+1} = 0$. Then $\g^i \subseteq Z(\g)$ and thus $Z(\g) \neq 0$.
  \item
   Since $\g$ is nilpotent there exists some $i \in \N$ with $\g^i = 0$. Then
   \[
    (\ad(x))^i(\g) \subseteq \g^i = 0,
   \]
   so $(\ad(x))^i = 0$.
  \item
   This follows inductively by using that $[I,J]$ is an ideal inside $\g$ for any $I,J \subideal \g$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}





\subsection{Engelâ€™s theorem}


From now on \emph{all} fields over which we work will be assumed to be algebraically closed, unless otherwise specified.


If $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $k$ and $x \in \End_k(V)$ a nilpotent endomorphism then $0$ is the only eigenvalue of $x$ (and occurs with multiplicity $n$) (here it is used that $k$ is algebraically closed). Hence there exists an eigenvector $v \in V$, $v \neq 0$ with $x(v) = 0$. The following proposition generalizes this observations for linear Lie algebras consisting of nilpotent endomorphisms.


\begin{prop}\label{prop: stuff for engels theorem}
 Let $V \neq 0$ be a finite dimensional vector space with $n = \dim V$ and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a Lie subalgebra such that every $x \in \g$ in nilpotent.
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   There exists $v \in V$ mit $v \neq 0$ and $x(v) = 0$ for every $x \in \g$, i.e.\ $v$ is a common eigenvector of all $x \in \g$ (all of which are nilpotent and thus have $0$ as their only eigenvalue).
  \item
   There exists a complete flag of $V$
   \[
    V = V_n \supsetneq V_{n-1} \supsetneq V_{n-2} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0,
   \]
   with $x(V_i) \subseteq V_{i-1}$ for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$.
  \item
   There exists a basis of $V$ with respect to which every $x \in \g$ is represented by an strictly upper triangular matrix.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   The statement can be then shown by induction over $\dim \g$. For $\dim \g = 0$ the statement follows from $\g = 0$ and for $\dim \g = 1$ the statement follows as previously discussed from $\g = k x$ with $x$ being a nilpotent endomorphism of $V$.
   
   So let $\dim \g \geq 2$ and suppose that the statement holds for all smaller dimensions. Let $I \subseteq \g$ be a maximal proper Lie subalgebra (such a subalgebra exists because it is precisely one of maximal dimension strictly smaller than $n$). Any $x \in \g$ with $x \neq 0$ spans a one-dimensional subalgebra $k x$ of $\g$; because $\dim \g \geq 2$ it is a proper one. This show that $I \neq 0$. It turns out that $I$ is already in ideal in $\g$:
   
   By assumption $\g$ consists of nilpotent endomorphisms and therefore of $\ad$-nilpotent elemenents. In particular every $x \in I$ acts nilpotent on $\g$ via $\ad(x)$ with $I$ being an $\ad(x)$-invariant linear subspace. Therefore every $x \in I$ acts on the quotient vector space $\g/I$ by an induced nilpotent endomorphism
   \[
    \overline{\ad}(x) \colon \g/I \to \g/I, \quad y + I \mapsto \ad(x)(y) + I = [x,y] + I.
   \]
   As the map $\overline{\ad} \colon I \to \gl(\g/I)$ is an homomorphism of Lie algebras (because $\ad$ is) the image $\{\overline{\ad}(x) \mid x \in I\} \subseteq \gl(\g/I)$ is an Lie subalgebra, consisting of nilpotent endomorphisms. From $I \neq 0$ it follows that $\dim \g/I < \dim \g$, so by induction assumption there exists some $y \in \g$ with $\overline{\ad}(x)(y+I) = 0$ for every $x \in I$ and $y+I \neq 0+I$. Hence $[x,y] \in I$ for every $x \in I$ but $y \neq I$. Hence $y \in N_\g(I)$ with $y \neq I$, so $I$ is properly contained in its normalizer. As $I$ is a maximal proper subalgebra of $\g$ it follows that $N_\g(I) = \g$, so $I$ is an ideal. It is even one of codimension $1$:
   
   If $I$ had not codimension $1$ then $\dim \g/I > 1$. Then $\g/I$ contains a one-dimensional proper subalgebra $L$ (as seen above), and the preimage $\pi^{-1}(J)$ under the canonical projection $\pi \colon \g \to \g/I$ is then a proper subalgebra of $\g$ properly containing $I$, which contradicts the maximality of $I$. Hence $I$ has codimension $1$.

   As $I \subseteq \g$ has codimension $1$ there exists some $y \in \g$ with $g = I \oplus ky$ (as vector spaces). Because $\dim I < \dim \g$ it follows from the induction assumption that
   \[
    U \coloneqq \{v \in V \mid \text{$x(v) = 0$ for every $x \in I$}\} = \bigcap_{x \in I} \ker x
   \]
   is a nonzero linear subspace of $V$. It sufficies to show that $U$ is $y$-invariant: Then there exists some eigenvector $u \in U$ of $y$ for which necessarily $y(u) = 0$. If $u\in U$ then $[x,y] \in I$ for every $x \in I$ because $I \subideal \g$ and therefore
   \[
    x(y(u)) = [x,y](u) - y(x(u)) = 0 - y(0) = 0.
   \]
   Hence $y(u) \in U$, so $U$ is $y$-invariant.
   
  \item
   This can be shown by induction over $\dim V$. For $\dim V = 1$ set $V_0 \coloneqq 0$ and $V_1 \coloneqq V$. By assumption every $x \in \g$ acts nilpotent on $V$, so $x(V) = 0$ because $V$ is one-dimensional. Thus $V = V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0$ is a complete flag for $V$ satisfying the condititons.
   
   Now let $\dim V = n \geq 2$ and suppose the statement holds for all smaller dimensions. Let $v \in V$, $v \neq 0$ with $x(v) = 0$ for every $x \in \g$ and $W \coloneqq V / kv$. Every $x \in \g$ induces an endomorphism
   \[
    \overline{x} \colon W \to W, \quad v + kv \mapsto x(v) + kv.
   \]
   By induction assumption exists a complete flag
   \[
    W = W_{n-1} \supsetneq W_{n-2} \supsetneq W_{n-3} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq W_1 \supsetneq W_0 = 0
   \]
   with $\overline{x}(W_i) \subseteq W_{i-1}$ for every $x \in \g$ and $i = 1, \dotsc, n-1$. By setting $V_i \coloneqq \pi^{-1}(W_{i-1})$ for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$ and $V_0 = 0$ it follows that
   \[
    V = V_n \supsetneq V_{n-1} \supsetneq V_{n-2} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0,
   \]
   is a complete flag of $V$. On the one hand $x(V_1) = x(kv) = 0 = V_0$ for every $x \in \g$ and on the other hand
   \[
    \pi(x(V_i))
    = \overline{x}(\pi(V_i))
    = \overline{x}(W_{i-1})
    \subseteq W_{i-2}
   \]
   and therefore $x(V_i) \subseteq \pi^{-1}(W_{i-2}) = V_{i-1}$ for every $i = 2, \dotsc, n$.
   
  \item
   This is a direct consequence from the previous part.
  \qedhere
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}



\begin{thrm}[Engel]
 Let $\g$ be a finite dimensional Lie algebra. Then $\g$ is nilpotent if and only if all its elements are $\ad$-nilpotent.
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
 If $\g$ is nilpotent then there exists some $i \in \N$ with $\g^i = 0$, from which is follows from $\ad(x)^i(y) \in \g^i$ for every $x,y \in \g$ that $\ad(x)^i = 0$ for every $x \in \g$, hence every $x \in \g$ is $\ad$-nilpotent.
 
 On the other hand suppose that $\g$ consists of $\ad$-nilpotent elemenents. If $\g = Z(\g)$ then $\g$ is abelian and hence nilpotent, so it sufficies to show the statement under the additional assumption that $Z(\g) \subsetneq \g$. Because $\g/Z(\g) \cong \ad \g$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\gl(\g)$ consisting of nilpotent Elemenents it follows from Proposition \ref{prop: stuff for engels theorem} that $\g/Z(\g)$ is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of $\nl_n(k)$ for $n = \dim \g/Z(\g) \geq 1$. Because $\nl_n(k)$ is nilpotent the same goes for $\g/Z(\g)$ as seen in Proposition \ref{prop: properties of solvable and nilpotent}.
\end{proof}





\subsection{Lieâ€™s theorem}


From now on we will not only require \emph{all} fields we work with to be algebraically closed, but also to be of characteristic $0$.


\begin{defi}
 Let $V$ be a $k$-vector space and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a Lie subalgebra. For $\lambda \in \g^*$ is
 \[
  V_\lambda \coloneqq \{v \in V \mid \text{$x(v) = \lambda x$ for every $x \in \g$}\}
 \]
 the \emph{$\g$-weight space} of $V$ with \emph{weight} $\lambda$.
\end{defi}



\begin{lem}[Invariance Lemma]
 Let $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ be a Lie subalgebra for a finite dimensional $k$-vector space $V$ and $I \subideal \g$. For $\lambda \in I^*$ let $V_\lambda$ be the $I$-weight space of $V$ with weight $\lambda$. Then $V_\lambda$ is $\g$-invariant, i.e.\ $x$-invariant for every $x \in \g$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 
\end{proof}



\begin{thrm}[Lie]
 Let $V \neq 0$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space with $n = \dim V$ and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a solvable Lie subalgebra.
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   There exists a common eigenvector for $\g$, i.e.\ some $v \in V$, $v \neq 0$ with $x(v) \in k v$ for every $x \in \g$.
  \item
   $\g$ stabilizes some complete flag of $V$, i.e.\ there exists a complete flag
   \[
    V = V_n \supsetneq V_{n-1} \supsetneq V_{n-2} \supsetneq \dotsb \supsetneq V_1 \supsetneq V_0 = 0,
   \]
   with $x(V_i) \subseteq V_i$ for every $x \in \g$ and $i = 0, \dotsc, n$.
  \item
   There exists a basis of $V$ up to which every $x \in \g$ is represented by an upper triangular matrix. In particular $\g$ is isomorphic to a Lie-subalgebra of $\tl_n(k)$ for $n = \dim V$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{thrm}


\begin{cor}
 A finite-dimensional $k$-Lie algebra $\g$ is solvable if and only if $[\g,\g]$ is nilpotent.
\end{cor}





\subsection{The Killing form and Cartanâ€™s criterion}



\subsubsection{The Killing form}




\begin{defi}
 Let $\g$ be a Lie algebra over an arbitrary field $k$. A bilinear form $\beta \colon \g \times \g \to k$ is called \emph{associative} if
 \[
  \beta([x,y],z) = \beta(x,[y,z])
  \quad \text{for all $x,y,z \in \g$}.
 \]
\end{defi}


\begin{lem}
 Let $\g$ be a Lie algebra over an arbitrary field $k$ and \mbox{$\beta \colon \g \times \g \to k$} a symmetric and associative bilinear form. For any ideal $I \subideal \g$ the orthogonal complement
 \[
  I^\perp \coloneqq \{y \in \g \mid \text{$\beta(x,y) = 0$ for every $x \in I$}\}
 \]
 is also an ideal in $\g$. In particular is
 \[
  \rad \beta \coloneqq \{y \in \g \mid \text{$\beta(x,y) = 0$ for every $x \in \g$}\} = \g^\perp
 \]
 an Ideal in $\g$.
\end{lem}


\begin{defi}
 Let $\g$ be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over an arbitrary field $k$. The \emph{Killing form} of $\g$ is the bilinear form
 \[
  \kappa \colon \g \times \g \to k
  \quad\text{with}\quad
  \kappa(x,y) = \tr(\ad(x) \ad(y))
  \quad\text{for all $x,y \in \g$}.
 \]
\end{defi}


\begin{lem}
 The Killing form $\kappa$ of an finite dimensional Lie algebra $\g$ over an arbitrary field $k$ is symmetric and associative.
\end{lem}



\subsubsection{The concrete Jordan decomposition}


\begin{defi}
 Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional $k$-vector space and $x \in \End_k(V)$ (resp.\ $y \in \Mat_n(y)$). Then $x$ (resp.\ $y$) is called \emph{semisimple} if it is diagonalizable.
\end{defi}


\begin{rem}
 An endomorphism $x \in \End_k(V)$ as above is semisimple if and only if every $x$-invariant subspace of $V$ has a direct summand which is also $x$-invariant. (This depends on $k$ being algebraically closed.)
\end{rem}


\begin{thrm}\label{thrm: concrete Jordan decomposition}
 Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space and $x \in \End_k(V)$.
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   There exist unique $x_s, x_n \in \End_k(V)$ satisfying the following properties:
   \begin{enumerate}
    \item
     $x = x_s + x_n$.
    \item
     $x_s$ is semisimple and $x_n$ is nilpotent.
    \item
     $x_s$ and $x_n$ commute.
   \end{enumerate}
  \item
   $x_s$ and $x_n$ are Polynomials in $x$ without constant term, i.e.\ there exist polynomials $P,Q \in k[T]$ such that $P(0) = Q(0) = 0$ and $x_s = P(x)$ and $x_n = P(x)$. In particular an endomorphism of $V$ commutes with $x$ if and only if it commutes with $x_s$ and $x_n$.
  \item
   If $A \subseteq B \subseteq V$ are linear subspaces with $x(B) \subseteq A$ then also $x_s(B) \subseteq A$ and $x_n(B) \subseteq A$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{thrm}
\begin{proof}
 Let $\chi(T)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $x$ with $\chi(T) = \prod_{i=1}^n (T-\lambda_i)^{m_i}$ where $\lambda_i \neq \lambda_j$ for $i \neq j$. By the chinese reminder theorem the map
 \begin{equation}\label{eqn: use of chinese reminder theorem}
  \begin{aligned}
   k[T]/(\chi) &\longrightarrow \prod_{i=1}^n k[T]/((T-\lambda_i)^{m_i}),\\
   F + (\chi) &\longmapsto (F+((T-\lambda_1)^{m_1}), \dotsc, F+(((T-\lambda_n)^{m_n}))
  \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
 is surjective. Thus there exists some polynomial $P \in k[T]$ with
 \begin{equation}\label{eqn: congruences of P}
  P(T) \equiv \lambda_i \mod (T-\lambda_i)^{m_i} \quad \text{for ever $i = 1, \dotsc, n$}.
 \end{equation}
 
 We can also assume that $P(0) = 0$. If $\lambda_i = 0$ for some $i$ then this follows directly from \eqref{eqn: congruences of P}. Otherwise the polynomials $(T-\lambda_1)^{m_1}$, \dots, $(T-\lambda_n)^{m_n}$, $T$ are pairwise coprime, so by replacing $\chi(T)$ with $\tilde{\chi}(T) \coloneqq \chi(T) T$ in \eqref{eqn: use of chinese reminder theorem} results in a polynomial $\tilde{P}$ which does not only satisfy \eqref{eqn: congruences of P} (with $P$ replaced by $\tilde{P}$) but also $\tilde{P} \bmod T = 0$.
 
 Now let $Q(T) \coloneqq T - P(T)$ as well as $x_s \coloneqq P(x)$ and $x_n \coloneqq Q(x)$. Then $x = x_s + x_n$ and $x_s$ and $x_n$ commute, as both are polynomials in $x$. For every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$ let
 \[
  V_i \coloneqq \ker (x-\lambda_i)^{m_i}
 \]
 be the generalized eigenspace of $x$ with respect to the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$. Is is known from linear algebra that $V = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n V_i$.
 
 It follows from \eqref{eqn: use of chinese reminder theorem} that for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$ there exists some polynomial \mbox{$P_i \in k[T]$} with
 \[
  P(T) = \lambda_i + P_i(T) (T-\lambda_i)^{m_i},
 \]
 from which follows for every $v \in V_i$ that
 \[
  x_s(v)
  = (\lambda_i \id_V + P_i(x)(x-\lambda_i)^{m_i})(v)
  = \lambda_i v + P_i(x)(\underbrace{(x-\lambda_i)^{m_i}(v)}_{=0})
  = \lambda_i v.
 \]
 Hence $V_i$ is $x_s$-invariant with $x_s|_{V_i} = \lambda_i \id_{V_i}$ for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$. As $V = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n V_i$ this shows that $x_s$ is semisimple and $V_i$ is precisely the eigenspace of $x_s$ to the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.
 
 To see that $x_s$ is nilpotent notice that for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$ and $v \in V_i$
 \[
  x_n(v) = x(v) - x_s(v) = x(v) - \lambda_i (v) = (x - \lambda_i \id_V)(v).
 \]
 Hence $V_i$ is $x_n$-invariant with $x_n|_{V_i} = x - \lambda_i \id_{V_i}$ for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$. By definition of $V_i$ it follows that $x_n|_{V_i}$ is nilpotent for every $i = 1, \dotsc, n$. Because $V = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n V_i$ it follows that $x_n$ is nilpotent.
 
 This shows the existence of the claimed decomposition. For the uniqueness let $y_s, y_n \in \End_k(V)$ be any two endomorphisms with $x = y_s + y_n$ where $y_s$ is semisimple, $y_n$ is nilpotent and $y_s$ and $y_n$ commute. As $y_s$ and $y_n$ commute it follows that each of them commutes with $x = y_s + y_n$. Because $x_s$ and $x_n$ are polynomials in $x$ it follows from this that $y_s$ and $y_n$ both commute with $x_s$ and $x_n$. Hence $x_s$, $x_n$, $y_s$ and $y_n$ are pairwise commuting. In particular $x_s$ and $y_s$ are simultaneously diagonalizable which is why $x_s - y_s$ is also semisimple. As $x_n$ and $y_n$ commute and are both nilpotent it also follows that $y_n - x_n$ is nilpotent. But from $x_s + x_n = x = y_s + y_n$ it follows that
 \[
  \underbrace{x_s - y_s}_{\text{semisimple}} = \underbrace{y_n - x_n}_{\text{nilpotent}}.
 \]
 Hence $x_s - y_s = y_n - x_n = 0$.
 
 All other statements of the theorem directly follow from the construction of $x_s$ and $x_n$ and the fact that they are polynomials without constant term in $x$.
\end{proof}



\begin{rem}\label{rem: concrete Jordan decomposition for matrices}
 An analogeous statement of Theorem \ref{thrm: concrete Jordan decomposition} can be shown for $\Mat_n(k)$ instead of $\End_k(V)$. More precisely: Every matrix $x \in \Mat_n(k)$ can be uniquely decomposed into $x = x_s + x_n$ such that $x_s$ is semisimple, $x_n$ is nilpotent and $x_s$ and $x_n$ commute. Both $x_s$ and $x_n$ are polynomials without constant term in $x$, so any matrix in $\Mat_n(k)$ commutes with $x$ if and only if it commutes with $x_s$ and $x_n$. If $A \subseteq B \subseteq k^n$ are linear subspaces such that $B$ is carried into $A$ by left multiplication with $x$, then the same goes for $x_s$ and $x_n$.
\end{rem}


\begin{defi}
 Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space and $x \in \End_k(V)$ (resp.\ $y \in \Mat_n(k)$). Then the decomposition $x = x_s + x_n$ from Theorem \ref{thrm: concrete Jordan decomposition} (resp.\ the decomposition $y = y_s + y_n$ from Remark \ref{rem: concrete Jordan decomposition for matrices}) is called the \emph{concrete Jordandecomposition} of $x$ (resp.\ $y$). The element $x_s$ (resp.\ $y_s$) is called the \emph{semisimple part} of $x$ (resp.\ $y$) and the element $x_n$ (resp.\ $y_n$) is called the \emph{nilpotent part} of $x$ (resp.\ $y$).
\end{defi}











\subsubsection{Cartanâ€™s Criterion}


\begin{lem}
 Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space. Let $A \subseteq B \subseteq \gl(V)$ be linear subspaces and let
 \[
  T \coloneqq \{z \in \gl(V) \mid \ad(z)(B) \subseteq A\}.
 \]
 If $x \in T$ and $\tr(xz) = 0$ for every $z \in T$ then $x$ is nilpotent.
\end{lem}


\begin{lem}[Cartanâ€™s criterion for $\gl(V)$]
 Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space and $\g \subseteq \gl(V)$ a Lie subalgebra. Then $\g$ is solvable if and only if $\tr(xy) = 0$ for every $x \in \g$ and $y \in [\g,\g]$.
\end{lem}


\begin{thrm}[Cartanâ€™s criterion for solvability]
 Let $\g$ be a finite dimensional $k$-Lie algebra. Then $\g$ is solvable if and only if
 \[
  \kappa(x,y) = 0 \quad \text{for every $x \in \g$ and $y \in [\g,\g]$}.
 \]
