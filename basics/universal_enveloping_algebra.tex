\section{The universal enveloping algebra}
The following hold for this section alone: We fix an arbitrary field $k$ and a Lie algebra $\g$ over $k$. All $k$-algebras have to be associative and unitary and all homomorphisms of $k$-algebras have to respect the unit.





\subsection{Definition and properties}


\begin{defi}
 An \emph{universal enveloping algebra} of $\g$ is an $k$-algebra $\Ue(\g)$ together with a homomorphism of Lie algebras $\iota \colon \g \to \Ue(\g)$ such that for every $k$-Algebra $A$ and homomorphism of Lie algebras $\phi \colon \g \to A$ there exists a unique homomorphism of $k$-algebras $\Phi \colon \Ue(\g) \to A$ with $\phi = \Phi \circ \iota$, i.e.\ making the following diagram commute:
 \begin{center}
  \tikzsetnextfilename{universal_property_of_universal_enveloping_algebra}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 5em]
   \node (g) {$\g$};
   \node[below of = g] (Ug) {$\Ue(\g)$};
   \node[right = 5em of Ug] (A) {$A$};
   \draw[->] (g) to node[left] {$\iota$} (Ug);
   \draw[->] (g) to node[above right] {$\phi$} (A);
   \draw[->, dashed] (Ug) to node[below] {$\Phi$} (A);
  \end{tikzpicture}
 \end{center}
\end{defi}


\begin{rem}
 As always with universal objects any two enveloping algebras of $\Ue(\g)_1$ with $\iota_1 \colon \g_1 \to \Ue(\g)_1$ and $\Ue(\g)_2$ with $\iota_2 \colon \g \to \Ue(\g)_2$ of $\g$ are isomorphic, and there exists a unique isomorphism $\varphi \colon \Ue(\g_1) \to \Ue(\g_2)$ with $\iota_2 = \varphi \colon \iota_1$, i.e.\ making the following diagram commute:
 \begin{center}
  \tikzsetnextfilename{uniqueness_of_universal_enveloping_algebra}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 5em]
   \node (g) {$\g$};
   \node[below left of = g] (U1) {$\Ue(\g)_1$};
   \node[below right of = g] (U2) {$\Ue(\g)_2$};
   \draw[->] (g) to node[above left] {$\iota_1$} (U1);
   \draw[->] (g) to node[above right] {$\iota_2$} (U2);
   \draw[->] (U1) to node[below] {$\varphi$} (U2);
  \end{tikzpicture}
 \end{center}
 Hence we will talk about \emph{the} universal enveloping algebra of $\g$.
\end{rem}





\subsection{Construction}


\begin{lem}
 Let $T(\g) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty \g^{\otimes n}$ be the tensor algebra and $\mc{I} \subseteq T(\g)$ the two-sided ideal generated by the element $x \otimes y - y \otimes x - [x,y]$ with $x,y \in \g$. The the quotient $\Ue(\g) \coloneqq T(\g)/\mc{I}$ together with the $k$-linear map
 \[
  \iota \colon \g \to \Ue(\g), \quad x \mapsto x + \mc{I}
 \]
 is an universal enveloping algebra of $\g$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 $\Ue(\g)$ is a $k$-algebra by construction and $\iota$ is a homomorphism of Lie algebras since for all $x,y \in \g$
 \begin{align*}
  [\iota(x),\iota(y)]
  &= [x + \mc{I}, y + \mc{I}]
  = (x + \mc{I})(y + \mc{I}) - (y + \mc{I})(x + \mc{I}) \\
  &= (x \otimes y - y \otimes x) + \mc{I}
  = [x,y] + \mc{I}
  = \iota([x,y]).
 \end{align*}
 Given any $k$-algebra $A$ and homomorphism of Lie algebras $\phi \colon \g \to A$ it can be uniquely extended to a homomorphism of $k$-algebras $\hat{\phi} \colon T(\g) \to A$ via
 \[
  \hat{\phi}(x_1 \otimes \dotsb \otimes x_n) = \phi(x_1) \dotsm \phi(x_n)
  \quad \text{for all $n \geq 0$ and $x_1, \dotsc, x_n \in \g$}.
 \]
 Because $\phi$ is not only $k$-linear but even a homomorphism of Lie algebras it follows that for all $x,y \in \g$
 \[
  \hat{\phi}(x \otimes y - y \otimes x)
  = \phi(x)\phi(y) - \phi(y)\phi(x)
  = [\phi(x),\phi(y)]
  = \phi([x,y])
  = \hat{\phi}([x,y])
 \]
 It follows that $\hat{\phi}(x) = 0$ for every $x \in \mc{I}$. Hence $\hat{\phi}$ factors through a unique homomorphism of $k$-algebras
 \[
  \Phi \colon \mc{U}(\g) \to A, \quad
  x_1 \otimes \dotsb \otimes x_n + \mc{I} \mapsto \phi(x_1) \dotsm \phi(x_n)
 \]
 for all $n \geq 0$ and $x_1, \dotsc, x_n \in \g$. For every $x \in \g$ it follows that
 \[
  (\Phi \circ \iota)(x)
  = \Phi(\iota(x))
  = \Phi(x + \mc{I}) 
  = \phi(x),
 \]
 which is why $\phi = \Phi \circ \iota$. That $\Phi$ is the unique homomorphism of $k$-algebras with this properties follows from the uniqueness of $\hat{\phi}$.
\end{proof}
