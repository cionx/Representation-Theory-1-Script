\section{Theorem of Weyl}


\begin{lem}
 Let $\g$ be an $n$-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra and $\rho \colon \g \to \gl(V)$ a representation of $\g$.
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item
   The map $\beta \colon \g \times \g \to k$ with $\beta(x,y) \coloneqq \tr(\rho(x)\rho(y))$ for all $x,y \in \g$ is an associative and symmetric bilinear form.
  \item
   If $\rho$ is a faithful representation then $\beta$ is non-degenerate.
  \item
   Suppose $\rho$ is faithful. Let $x_1, \dotsc, x_n$ ba a basis of $\g$ and $x^1, \dotsc, x^n$ the dual basis with respect to $\beta$. Then the map
   \[
    C_\beta^V \colon V \to V,
    \quad
    v \mapsto C_\beta \cdot v = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i.x^i.v = \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(x_i)\rho(x^i)(v)
   \]
   is a homomorphism of representations with $\tr(C_\beta^V) = \dim_k \g$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
   This was already remarked in Remark~\ref{rem: associative bilinear form of a representation}.
  \item
   Because $\rad \beta \subideal \g$ is and $\rho$ is an isomorphism onto its image it follows that $\rho(\rad \beta) \subideal \rho(\g)$ is an ideal with $\tr(xy) = 0$ for all $x,y \in \rho(\g)$. By Cartanâ€™s criterion for linear Lie algebras (see Lemma~\ref{lem: Cartans criterion for linear Lie algebra}) the ideal $\rho(\rad \beta)$ is solvable. Because $\rho(\g)$ is semisimple it follows that $\rho(\rad \beta) = 0$ and hence $\rad \beta = 0$ because $\rho$ is faithful.
  \item
   That $C_\beta^V$ is a homomorphism of representations was follows from Corollary~\ref{cor: Casimir homomorphism of a representation} and notice that
   \[
    \tr(C_\beta^V)
    = \tr\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(x_i)\rho(x^i) \right)
    = \sum_{i=1}^n \tr(\rho(x_i)\rho(x^i))
    = \sum_{i=1}^n \beta(x_i, x^i)
    = n
    = \dim \g.
    \qedhere
   \]
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
