# Representation-Theory-1-Skript
My notes for Representation Theory I.

There are two sources for compiled versions on the web, both of which are (hopefully) up-do-date: The first is
http://ci.aufenthaltsraum.cf/representation-theory-1-script.
This version is compiled by the Integrity service with code directly pulled from the repo.
A second source is
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/public.php?service=files&t=a20a94c60db211889f9202025b46dcea&download.
This version is compiled by myself. It is the one I work with and is updated everytime I push changes to the repo.

Ideally both versions always coincides.
