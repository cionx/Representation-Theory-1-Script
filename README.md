Notes About Lie Algebras and Their Representations
=================

This repository contains some persional notes about the representation theory of Lie algebras.
These notes were originally based on the the lecture course _Representation Theory I_ that was given by Prof. Dr. Catharina Stroppel at the University of Bonn in the summer term of 2015, but have been rewritten since then.

A compiled version of the notes can be downloaded [here][1].
