# Representation-Theory-1-Skript
My notes for Representation Theory I.

There are two sources for compiled versions on the web, both of which are (hopefully) up-do-date: The first is  
http://ci.aufenthaltsraum.cf/representation-theory-1-script.  
This version is compiled by the Integrity service with code directly pulled from the repo. A second source is  
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/public.php?service=files&t=a20a94c60db211889f9202025b46dcea&download.  
This version is compiled by myself. It is the one I work with and is updated everytime I push changes to the repo.

For those of you who want to compile the project yourself the project comes with its own build script. It is horribily slow and inefficient, but it (hopefully) works. (It will probably be replaced by a better version at some point in the future. Right now its main function is to make sure that Integrity has a routine which assures finite build time.)

Ideally both versions always coincides. Both of these show only the changes I pushed.
