Notes for _Representation Theory I_, SS 15
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cionx/representation-theory-1-notes-ss-15.svg?branch=master)][1]
=================

This repository contains my personal notes for the lecture course _Representation Theory I_ that was held the University of Bonn in the summer semester of 2015 by Prof. Dr. Catharina Stroppel.
A compiled version of the current status can be found [here][2].

For those who want to compile these notes themselves:

- The `EB Garamond` font is used as the main font.
  A combination of  the packages `ebgaramond-maths` and `newtxmath` is used for the math font.
- Compiling is intented to be done using `lualatex`.
- The bibliography is using `biblatex` with the `biber` backend.
- The `gitinfo2` package is used to display the date and hash of the last commit.
- The included `make` file is intented for remote building via [travis.ci][3].

For comments and corrections please contact me at `stelzner (at) uni-bonn.de`.
