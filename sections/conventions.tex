\chapter{Conventions}

We collect here some conventions and notational choices which we will use throughout most of these notes.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    We often write \enquote{for all~$i = j_1, \dotsc, j_n$} instead of \enquote{for all~$i \in \{ j_1, \dotsc, j_n \}$}.
  \item
    We write~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n = y$ to mean that~$x_i = y$ for all~$i = 1, \dotsc, n$.
  \item
    If~$f$ is a function from a set~$X$ to a set~$Y$ then the application of~$f$ to an element~$x$ of~$X$ is denoted by~$f(x)$.
  \item
    If~$f$ is a function from a set~$X$ to a set~$Y$ and~$g$ is a function from this set~$Y$ to a set~$Z$ then the composite of these two functions -- a function from~$X$ to~$Z$ -- is denoted by~$g \circ f$.
  \item
    We denote by~$\Natural$ the abelian monoid of natural numbers -- including zero --, by~$\Integer$ the ring of integers, by~$\Rational$ the field of rational numbers, by~$\Real$ the ordered field of real numbers, and by~$\Complex$ the field of complex numbers.
  \item
    We denote abstract fields by~$\kf$ or~$\Kf$.
    Elements of fields, i.e. scalars, are denoted by lower case Greek letters near~$\lambda$.
  \item
    Vector spaces are denoted by upper case Latin letters near~$V$.
    Elements of vector spaces, i.e. vectors, are denoted by lower case Latin letters near~$v$.
    Homomorphism of vector spaces, i.e. linear maps, are denoted by lower case Latin letters near~$f$.
  \item
    Lie algebras are denoted by lower case Fraktur letters near~$\glie$.
    Elements of Lie algebras are denoted by lower case Latin letters near~$x$.
    Homomorphisms of Lie~algebras are denoted by lower case Greek letters near~$\varphi$.
  \item
    General algebras as well as associative, unital algebras are denoted by upper case Latin letters near~$A$.
    Elements of such algebras are denoted by lower case Latin letters near~$a$.
    Homomorphisms of such algebras are denoted by upper case Greek letters near~$\Phi$
  \item
    Ideals and Lie~ideals are denoted by upper case Latin letters near~$I$.
  \item
    Representations and modules are denoted by upper case Latin letters near~$M$.
    Elements of those structures are denoted by lower case Latin letters near~$m$.
    Homomorphisms of these structures are denoted by lower case Latin letters near~$f$.
  \item
    If~$V$ is a vector space then the elements of the dual space~$\varphi$ are denoted by lower case Greek letters near~$\varphi$.
  \item
    Matrices are denoted by upper case Latin letters near~$A$.
  \item
    Operations which assign to a mathematical object some kind of structure (a set, group, vector space, algebra, etc.) are denoted by upper case Latin letters.
