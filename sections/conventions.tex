\chapter{Conventions}

We collect here some conventions and notational choices that we will use throughout most of these notes.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
		We often write \enquote{for all~$i = j_1, \dotsc, j_n$} instead of \enquote{for all~$i \in \{ j_1, \dotsc, j_n \}$}.
	\item
		We write~$x_1, \dotsc, x_n = y$ to mean that~$x_i = y$ for all~$i = 1, \dotsc, n$.
	\item
		If~$f$ is a function from a set~$X$ to a set~$Y$, then the application of~$f$ to an element~$x$ of~$X$ is denoted by~$f(x)$.
	\item
		If~$f$ is a function from a set~$X$ to a set~$Y$ and~$g$ is a function from this set~$Y$ to a set~$Z$, then the composite of these two functions -- a function from~$X$ to~$Z$ -- is denoted by~$g \circ f$ or~$gf$.
	\item
		We denote by~$\Natural$ the abelian monoid of natural numbers, by~$\Integer$ the ring of integers, by~$\Rational$ the field of rational numbers, by~$\Real$ the ordered field of real numbers, and by~$\Complex$ the field of complex numbers.
	\item
		We denote abstract fields by~$\kf$ or~$\Kf$.
		Elements of fields, i.e. scalars, are denoted by lower case Greek letters around~$\lambda$.
	\item
		Vector spaces are denoted by upper case Latin letters around~$V$.
		Elements of vector spaces, i.e. vectors, are denoted by lower case Latin letters around~$v$.
		Homomorphism of vector spaces, i.e. linear maps, are denoted by lower case Latin letters around~$f$.
	\item
		Lie algebras are denoted by lower case Fraktur letters around~$\glie$.
		Elements of Lie algebras are denoted by lower case Latin letters around~$x$.
		Homomorphisms of Lie~algebras are denoted by lower case Greek letters around~$\varphi$.
	\item
		General algebras are denoted by uppercase Fraktur letters around~$\Aalg$.
		Elements of such algebras are denoted by lower case Latin letters arouond~$a$.
		Homomorphism of such algebras are denoted by upper case letters around~$\Phi$.
	\item
		Associative algebras are denoted by upper case Latin letters around~$A$.
		Elements of such algebras are denoted by lower case Latin letters around~$a$.
		Homomorphisms of such algebras are denoted by upper case Greek letters around~$\Phi$
	\item
		Ideals and Lie~ideals are denoted by upper case Latin letters around~$I$.
	\item
		Representations and modules are denoted by upper case Latin letters around~$M$.
		Elements of those structures are denoted by lower case Latin letters around~$m$.
		Homomorphisms of these structures are denoted by lower case Latin letters around~$f$.
	\item
		If~$V$ is a vector space, then the elements of the dual space~$V^*$ are denoted by lower case latin letters around~$v$ together with a star~$*$ in the superscript (i.e.~$v^*$,~$w^*$ and so on).
	\item
		Matrices are denoted by upper case Latin letters around~$A$.
	\item
		Operations that assign to a mathematical object some kind of structure (e.g. functors) are denoted by upper case Latin letters.
	\item
		We denote the identity matrix of any size by~$\Id$, and the identity function of a set~$X$ by~$\id_X$.
\end{itemize}

We may stray from these conventions when it is useful to do so.
