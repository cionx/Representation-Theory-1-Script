\chapter*{Preface}

The following are my personal notes about the representation theory of (semisimple) Lie algebras.
These notes were originally based on the lecture course \emph{Representation~Theory~I} that was given by Prof.~Dr.~Catharina Stroppel at the University of Bonn in the summer term~2015.
The notes are currently under heavy reconstruction.
If you have comments or corrections regarding these notes, feel free to contact me at \href{mailto:jendrikstelzner@uni-bonn.de}{jendrikstelzner@uni-bonn.de}.
