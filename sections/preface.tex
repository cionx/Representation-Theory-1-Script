\chapter{Preface}

The following text is based on my notes for the lecture \emph{Representation Theory I} which was given by Prof.\ Dr.\ Stroppel during the summer term 2015 at the University of Bonn. The lecture is mostly about the finite dimensional representation theory of finite dimensional semisimple complexe Lie-Algebras. No previous knowledge about Lie-Algebras is required. At a few points I also took some motivation from \cite{Humphreys}, mostly to clarify some proofs.

These notes have mainly two purposes: One is to prepare myself for the exam, as typing out these notes forces myself to go trough them at a slow speed, paying much attention to details and look things up if necessary. The other is to allow the other students to learn with some nicely typed out text instead of a bunch of handwritten (and sometimes non-existing) notes.
