\chapter{Lie Algebra (Co)homology I}
\label{lie algebra cohomology}


\begin{fluff}
	In this \lcnamecref{lie algebra cohomology} we give a rather explicit introduction to Lie algebra cohomology and Lie algebra homology.
	We try to avoid assuming previous knowledge of homological algebra as far as possible.
