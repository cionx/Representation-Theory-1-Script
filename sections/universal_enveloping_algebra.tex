\chapter{The Universal Enveloping Algebra}


\begin{convention}
  The following holds for this section alone:
  We fix an arbitrary field~$\kf$.
  By a~{\algebra{$\kf$}} we always mean an associative and unitary one, and homomorphisms of~{\algebras{$\kf$}} have to respect the units.
  The resulting category of~{\algebras{$\kf$}} with homomorphisms of~{\algebra{$\kf$}} between them will be denoted by~$\cAlg{\kf}$.
  All Lie~algebras considered will have~$\kf$ as their ground field, unless otherwise stated.
  
  If~$A$ is a~{\algebra{$\kf$}} then by an~\defemph{\module{$A$}}\index{module} we mean a left unitial~{\module{$A$}}.
  The resulting category of~{\modules{$A$}} is denoted by~\gls*{module category}.
\end{convention}
